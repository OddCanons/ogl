# Unicorn

See the ”Unicorn” entry in the Dungeons & Dragons *Monster Manual*, page 295.

The unicorn race is overpowered compared to other races, particularly at lower levels. Challenge ratings should be adjusted accordingly. A 9th-level unicorn player character will be everything a normal adult unicorn is along with all of the class benefits.  Unicorns are intended for solo adventures or campaigns featuring unicorns, pegasi and other Celestial races. 

## Celestial Guardian

Unicorns are celestial beings. They are most commonly assigned to be guardians of natural areas or regions that have significance to one of the celestial powers. A 1st-level unicorn will almost always begin its career with an assignment from some celestial power to guard a particular natural feature or lesser temple. A unicorn will not willingly abandon her guardian duties unless in service of an obvious greater good or by the order of a higher ranking celestial being. Unicorn backgrounds are limited to acolyte, entertainer, folk hero, hermit, noble, outlander or sage.

## Unicorn Names

Unicorns have complex celestial names that are given to them at birth. Unicorns also have common names, in Elvan or Sylvan, that they choose before taking on their first assignments. Common names are either noble or whimsically related to nature.
