# Let's get a little bit Gritty.

> Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.

T.S. Eliot, Preface to Harry Crosby, _Transit of Venus_

> Well, it’s one louder, isn’t it? It’s not ten. You see, most, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten – you’re on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up – you’re on ten on your guitar, where can you go from there? Where?

Nigel Tufnel, _This is Spinal Tap_



# A Fistful of Grit

The _Dungeon Masters Guide_ (DMG) (5e) includes several options for raising the grit level in an OGL setting. These include most of the combat options in the back of the book. **Action Options**, **Cleaving Through Creatures**, **Injuries**, and **Massive Damage** form a nice kit for making combat more decisive and the potential effects more permanent. The setting becomes truly gritty when you pull in the **Healing** options and **Rest Variants** to add prerequisites for healing and to slow healing in general. For the right kinds of campaigns, **Fear and Horror**, **Madness**, and use of the **Sanity** score are also thematically gritty.

For dark or survival themed campaigns like _The Curse of Strahd_ or _Tomb of Annihilation_ our group typically adopts all of the following optional rules from the _DMG_:
* Roll damage, instead of using average damage. The gritty world is a random world.
* **Story-Based Advancement** keeps the focus on the narrative and the characters, instead of tracking XP. (_DMG_ 261)
* Some of the optional **Healing** rules make healing slower and more difficult. (_DMG_ 266-267)
  * The **Healer's Kit Dependency** is logical and makes equipment more important. (_DMG_ 266)
  * **Slow Natural Healing** "works well for grittier, more realistic campaigns." (_DMG_ 267)
* The **Gritty Realism** rest variant has gritty right there in its name. (_DMG_ 267)
* The **Action Options** are fun and bring more gritty physicality to conflict. (_DMG_ 271-272)
* **Cleaving through Creatures** is also pretty gritty, when high-powered characters are taking on minor foes. (_DMG_ 272)
* **Massive Damage** applies equally to NPCs and PCs. It's grittier. It puts even more emphasis on Constitution. (_DMG_ 273)
* **Injuries** are the gritty reminder of dangers of the setting. We always use the critical hits option, because it works in the flow of the game. We usually use the badly failed death save as well. Even at our grittiest, we usually don't use the 0 hp option, because there are already significantly gritty consequences for that. (_DMG_ 272-273)
* **Fear and Horror** are always available for a key moment in the story. (_DMG_ 266)

In truth, we've started playing almost every campaign with these optional rules, unless we're aiming for vertiginous fantasy.

For more Lovecraftian horror-themed campaigns we add:
* Each character has a **Sanity** score from the **New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity** section. (_DMG_ 264-266)
* This brings in **Madness**. (_DMG_ 258-260)

# For A Few Grits More

That's about as far as the official variants can take us into a gritty world. We'll have to make our own trail from here.
