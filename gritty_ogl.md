# Let's get a little bit Gritty.

> Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.

T.S. Eliot, Preface to Harry Crosby, _Transit of Venus_

> Well, it’s one louder, isn’t it? It’s not ten. You see, most, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten – you’re on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up – you’re on ten on your guitar, where can you go from there? Where?

Nigel Tufnel, _This is Spinal Tap_

The [Systems Reference Document](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) (SRD) for 5e is a fantastic jumping off point for fantasy roleplay. It leans toward high fantasy, with heroic characters jumping up from even the most grievous of wounds to win the day. Hit points flow back into them as if from a river. Injuries have no permanent effects. Damage is an concept talked about only in abstract units. Sometimes, we desire more grit in a setting, more lasting consequences for the characters, a harder road for them to walk.

This document describes ways to add more grit to your SRD-based settings. It goes beyond remembering how **Falling** (SRD 86) and **Suffocating** (SRD 86) work to applying first official optional rules and then two levels of house rules to your Open Gaming License (OGL) based games.

# A Fistful of Grit

The _Dungeon Masters Guide_ (DMG) (5e) includes several options for raising the grit level in an OGL setting. These include most of the combat options in the back of the book. **Action Options**, **Cleaving Through Creatures**, **Injuries**, and **Massive Damage** form a nice kit for making combat more decisive and the potential effects more permanent. The setting becomes truly gritty when you pull in the **Healing** options and **Rest Variants** to add prerequisites for healing and to slow healing in general. For the right kinds of campaigns, **Fear and Horror**, **Madness**, and use of the **Sanity** score are also thematically gritty.

For dark or survival themed campaigns like _The Curse of Strahd_ or _Tomb of Annihilation_ our group typically adopts all of the following optional rules from the DMG:
* Roll damage, instead of using average damage. The gritty world is a random world.
* **Story-Based Advancement** keeps the focus on the narrative and the characters, instead of tracking XP. (DMG 261)
* _Some_ of the optional **Healing** rules make healing slower and more difficult. (DMG 266-267)
  * The **Healer's Kit Dependency** is logical and makes equipment more important. (DMG 266)
  * **Slow Natural Healing** "works well for grittier, more realistic campaigns." (DMG 267)
* The **Gritty Realism** rest variant has gritty right there in its name. (DMG 267)
* The **Action Options** are fun and bring more gritty physicality to conflict. (DMG 271-272)
* **Cleaving through Creatures** is also pretty gritty, when high-powered characters are taking on minor foes. (DMG 272)
* **Massive Damage** applies equally to NPCs and PCs. It's grittier. It puts even more emphasis on Constitution. (DMG 273)
* **Injuries** are the gritty reminder of dangers of the setting. We always use the critical hits option, because it works in the flow of the game. We usually use the badly failed death save as well. Even at our grittiest, we usually don't use the 0 hp option, because there are already significantly gritty consequences for reaching 0 hp. (DMG 272-273)
* **Fear and Horror** are always available for a key moment in the story. (DMG 266)

In truth, my groups play almost every campaign with the above optional rules, unless we're aiming for vertiginous fantasy. We also use the **Sleep** (XGtE 77-78), **Tool Proficiencies** (XGtE 78-85), and **Spellcasting** (XGtE 85-88) rules from _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_ (XGtE).

For more Lovecraftian horror-themed campaigns we add:
* Each character has a **Sanity** score from the **New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity** section. (DMG 264-266)
* This brings in **Madness**. (DMG 258-260)

# For A Few Grits More

That's about as far as the official options can take us into a gritty world. We'll have to make our own trail from here. This section introduces more optional/house rules that build on the optional rules from the DMG and XGtE.

## Skill-based Healing

In addition to the **Healer's Kit Dependency**, a character can't spend any Hit Dice to heal after finishing a short rest, unless someone makes a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check. Only one check is allowed per character wishing to heal per short rest. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is _poisoned_. The DC of the check depends on the current hit points of the character relative to their max hit points.

| Relative Hit Points | DC of Wisdowm (Medicine) Check |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| >= 1/2 | 10 |
| < 1/2 | 15 |

## Skill-based First Aid

Stabilizing a character at 0 hit points _always_ requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DC is 10 if the character has a healer's kit. It is 15 if the character does not have access to a healer's kit.

## Improvised Healer's Kit

If there is no healer's kit available, a character may make a separate Wisdom (Survival) check to search for materials nearby to substitute for the healer's kit before an attempt to heal is made. The DC of the check is 10 if the person making the check is familiar with the surrounding flora or if the check is made in relatively civilized surroundings (e.g an enemy camp). The DC increases for unfamiliar or inhospitable territory. A successful search takes 10 minutes, minus the amount the character succeeded the check by, to a minimum of 1 minute. A failed search takes 10 minutes. It is assumed that any improvised or plant-based alternatives will not last and so must be found when needed. Given the likely length of a search, this part of the rule is expected to be much more useful during a short rest than to help with stabilizing a character.

## Stable to Weak

If played by the rules, the **stable** condition already provides for much of what is needed for grittier near death outcomes. Unless characters have access to magical or divine healing, there is no way to avoid being unconscious for 1d4 hours before regaining exactly 1 hit point. This rule builds on the **stable** condition to prevent characters from jumping up at full fighting capacity with just a little magical healing while still allowing for major healing effects to result in heroic outcomes.

A character that is magically healed from 0 hit points loses the **stable** condition, if they had it, and gains the **weak** condition. If that magical healing or later magical healing takes the character's hit point total to half or more of their maximum hit points, they lose the **weak** condition as well. A long rest or _any_ successful healing during a short rest will also remove the **weak** condition.

### Weak

* A weak creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
* The creature's speed is halved.
* The creature may not take reactions.

A character must start a short rest with at least 1 hit point to benefit from the short rest. The 1d4 hours of being **stable** have to run their course before their short rest starts, unless magical healing is provided.

## Wait Your Turn

No matter how your group determines initiative, you can apply **Speed Factor** for more intense (and gritty) action. (DMG 270-271). This requires coordination between the GM and party. A character who has a creature size modifier should always apply it to their roll. Characters who wish to take actions with a positive bonus should include that in their declared roll. If, when the character's turn comes, the character decides to do something with a worse modifier, they wait until their turn would normally come. Apply negative factors (not creature size) modifiers only to resolving the action, not to when it is declared. For example, a medium-sized character with a +0 dexterity bonus who rolls a 12 and wants to attack with a heavy weapon would declare the attack at initiative 12, but it would not resolve until initiative 10. This creates more of a to-and-fro in the combat that takes character action choices into consideration. If two characters declared actions on different initiative steps, but resolve them on the same step, the character who declared at the higher step resolves their action first. Otherwise, actions resolve at the same step simultaneously.

# True Grit

In this section we test the limits of how far we're willing to go in the name of grit. There is no turning back from this desert. Grit is our new goddess of death. All praise be to Grit.

Under the current SRD, mid-to-high-level combats frequently turn into carnivals of grinding in which participants are trading relatively small amounts of damage after the initial strikes. What should be exciting combats turn into marathons of wash, rinse, and repeat actions.
